# Landing Page : The Odin Project

## Overview
This project is a web page built from a provided design. The goal was to recreate the layout and style using HTML and CSS.  

The page includes four main sections and a footer. Images and content can be customized, and free-to-use images were used with proper attribution.  

All code is in a single CSS file (`style.css`) and the HTML file (`index.html`). This project demonstrates skills in HTML structure, CSS styling, and basic web layout using flexbox.
